Above is a screenshot of my photogallery app

In this assignment, I used four components to layer the app I created. 

The "App.js" uses Router, Switch, and Link in order to create a home page that allows you to click into links that are dynamically generated from information stored in the "Data.json" file. It is dynamically generated because it passes props through the different components. If I were to expand the JSON file to have more information, it would generate more links without me creating new places for those links to display. That's the magic of dynamic generation!
